# react-maze

A React project that allows the user to build, edit, and solve mazes using [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).

Maze data is stored as a matrix in JSON files where `0` represents a path, `1` represents a wall, `2` represents the start point, and `3` represents the end point.
